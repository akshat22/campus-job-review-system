## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality, please follow these coding standards:

- **Code Formatting**: We use `autopep8` and `black` for automatic formatting. Run these tools before submitting your code to ensure consistent style:
```bash
autopep8 --in-place --recursive .
black .
```

- **Linting**: We use `pylint` to enforce code quality. Run pylint locally and resolve any reported issues:
```bash
pylint your_code_file.py
```

- **Linting and Complexity Checks with Flake8**: `Flake8` is also used to catch syntax errors, undefined names, and complexity issues in the CI workflow:
```bash
flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
```
These checks run automatically in our CI pipeline but should also be run locally before submitting a PR.
