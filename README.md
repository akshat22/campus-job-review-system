## 💡 Why This Project?

Finding a job on campus can be overwhelming. Students often rely on word-of-mouth recommendations or limited information. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a platform where students can:

- **Access Real Reviews**: Get honest feedback from peers about their job experiences.
- **Make Informed Decisions**: Choose roles that align with their skills and preferences.
- **Support Fellow Students**: Contribute to the community by sharing their own experiences.

By fostering transparency and collaboration, our platform empowers students to navigate the campus job market confidently.

## 📈 Use Case

**Scenario**: Meet **Alex**, a sophomore at NC State who is looking for a part-time job to support his studies and gain experience. Alex wants to know what it’s like to work at the campus library, but he only hears mixed reviews from friends.

**How the Campus Job Review System Helps**:

1. **Search for Reviews**: Alex uses the platform to search for “campus library” and quickly finds multiple reviews detailing work conditions, flexibility, and overall job satisfaction.

2. **Read Feedback**: He reads honest and detailed feedback from current and former student employees, giving him insights into the work culture and expected responsibilities.

3. **Make a Decision**: Armed with this information, Alex feels more confident applying for the job, knowing what to expect and how to best prepare for the interview.

This is just one example of how our system can help students like Alex navigate their campus job search effectively!

We do not own or manage this data; instead, our system serves as an interface to make job listings more accessible to NC State students by aggregating real-time job opportunities for convenient browsing. All job data is the property of NC State University Campus Enterprises, and any changes or updates to job listings on their website will be reflected here accordingly.
