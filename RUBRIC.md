|Video1|3|     [Demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HqvInvVd4BRZCU7ygsuMz6vutRqEJ1RU/view?usp=sharing) (Also in README.md)        |
|Bonus: Xfold improvement|3| Deployment on AWS and load testing gave us result of much greater than 300 concurrent user handling |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)|3|In GitHub (before each class and function)|
|Use of style checkers|3|Using [Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/)|
|Use of code formatters|3|Using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and using Pycharm IDEA using ctrl + alt + J for back-end|
|Use of syntax checkers|3|Using Visual Studio Code and it's shortcuts for Front End|
|Use of code coverage|3||
|Other automated analysis tools|2|Used CodeCov to see coverage and other class analysis|
|Workload is spread over the whole team|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system/pulse)|
|Number of commits|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system)|
|Number of commits: by different people|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system/pulse)|
|Issues reports|3|[Issues](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system/issues)|
|DOI badge|3|[DOI](https://zenodo.org/record/7398576#.Y46hsXZBy5c)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly|3||
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|3| In README.md|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|In README.md|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3| In README.md|
|Use of version control tools|3|Usage of GitHub|
|Test cases exist|3|[Tests](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system/tree/main/tests)|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3|[GitHub actions](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system/actions)|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3|[CONTRIBUTING.MD]()|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)|
|Chat channel: exists|3|[Discord Server](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hJyumk-VMGdoJKOBiQ9zA6T7Mkp2MPPC/view?usp=sharing) for group discussions|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|3|Multiple people working on files across the project. Example: [](https://github.com/ashishjoshi2605/ncsu-campus-jobs-review-system/compare/main...akshat22:campus-job-review-system:feature/development_by_tilak) |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools(e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3||
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2| Divided work between front-end and back-end|
|Short release cycles|2|[Releases](https://github.com/akshat22/campus-job-review-system/releases)|
